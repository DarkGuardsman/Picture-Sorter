# Picture-Sorter
Simple program to sort out images contained in download and screenshot folders.

### Idea
Often I run into the issue were I have taken 100s of screenshots or downloaded dozens of images of the net. Then have had to manually sort out folders that have been building up with these images for weeks. This would take several hours and end up with many sub folders with oddly named images. The idea behind this program is to solve this problem in a very productive way. In which a GUI driven application will open one image at a time allowing the user to sort it threw simple button presses. This will also include a way to rename the files and setup default storage locations for images.
